## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Backend Framework
- **AWS Amplify Gen 2**: Latest Amplify framework with TypeScript
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code

### Services
- **Amazon Cognito**: User authentication and management
- **AWS AppSync**: GraphQL API (via Amplify Data)
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for user data
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for images
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for processing
- **Amazon Bedrock Nova Canvas**: AI-powered virtual try-on

### Dependencies
- `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`: Bedrock API client
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3`: S3 operations
- `sharp`: High-performance image processing
- `@aws-amplify/backend`: Amplify Gen 2 framework
- `aws-cdk-lib`: AWS CDK constructs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Sandbox
```bash
npm run sandbox
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 📱 Android Integration

After deployment, integrate with Android app:

1. Copy `amplify_outputs.json` to `app/src/main/res/raw/`
2. Initialize Amplify in your Application class
3. Use the provided Kotlin examples in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## 🎯 Key Features for Mobile App

### User Photo Management
- Upload multiple user photos
- Set default photo for quick try-on
- View photo gallery
- Delete unwanted photos

### Virtual Try-On

- Lambda: ~$1 (covered by free tier for most usage)
- S3 Storage: ~$1-2 (depends on retention)
- DynamoDB: Free tier covers moderate usage
- API Gateway: ~$0.50

**Total: ~$40-45/month for 1,000 try-ons**

2. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Complete API reference with examples
3. **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Step-by-step deployment guide
4. **This file**: Implementation summary

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before First Deployment
1. ✅ Request Amazon Bedrock access to Nova Canvas model
2. ✅ Configure AWS credentials
3. ✅ Install all dependencies
4. ✅ Review IAM permissions

### Known Limitations
- Bedrock Nova Canvas is currently available in limited regions (us-east-1, us-west-2)
- Processing time depends on image size and Bedrock load
- Concurrent request limits depend on AWS account quotas
- Sharp library requires native compilation (works out-of-box with Lambda)

### Future Enhancements
- WebSocket support for real-time status updates
- Batch processing for multiple try-ons
- Social sharing features
- User favorites/wishlist
- Style recommendations based on history
- Multi-garment try-on in single session

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dependencies not installed
**Solution**: Run `npm install` in project root

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution**: Errors are mostly warnings for unused exports (normal for library code)

### Issue: Deployment fails
**Solution**: Check AWS credentials and Bedrock access

### Issue: Virtual try-on takes too long
**Solution**: Bedrock processing typically takes 10-30 seconds; adjust Lambda timeout if needed

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
